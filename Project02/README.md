It also includes an introduction and side projects. The side projects come with an option to view the source code and the up and running project.

## Custom Javascript Code
#####   Weather Based Color
The current temperature is found by making an API request to a [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) weather API. Using the current temperature, the title's color changes based on whether it is good weather (>20), okay weather (0-20) or cold weateher (<0). 

#####   Contact Form Submission
The contact form is fully functional with the help of an external resource - [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/). The submit button takes all of the form data and makes a POST request to FormSpree. FormSpree then recieves the request and sends the data over to my McMaster email.
